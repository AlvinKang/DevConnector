# DevConnector
DevConnector is a multi-page social media platform for developers. 
This was built as part of the Udemy course [MERN Stack Front To Back](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/), taught by Brad Traversy.

In the course, instrutor Brad Traversy takes his students through the entire process of setting up 
and deploying a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application.
